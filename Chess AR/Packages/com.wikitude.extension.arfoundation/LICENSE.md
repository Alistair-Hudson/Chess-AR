ACCORDINGLY, IF PROVISIONS OF SUCH JURISDICTIONS OVERRULE THE CHOICE OF LAW MADE IN THE TERMS OF SERVICE, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

11	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES
11.1	YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WIKITUDE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF WIKITUDE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), (i) ARISING OUT OF OR RESULTING FROM THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE WIKITUDE SDK OR (ii) RESULTING FROM PRODUCT WARRANTIES, END USER ASSISTANCE AND PRODUCT SUPPORT WITH RESPECT TO THE WIKITUDE SDK AND/OR APPLICATIONS DEVELOPED WITH THE HELP OF THE WIKITUDE SDK. IN PARTICULAR, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER AUSTRIAN LAW, LIABILITY FOR SLIGHT NEGLIGENCE IS EXCLUDED.

11.2	ANY MATERIAL OR SOFTWARE USED THROUGH THE WIKITUDE SDK IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA OR ANY OTHER DAMAGE THAT RESULTS FROM THE USE OF THE WIKITUDE SDK, RESPECTIVELY.

11.3	YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR (AND THAT WIKITUDE HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR) ANY DERIVATIVE WORK YOU CREATE, DISTRIBUTE AND/OR MAKE OTHERWISE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR ACTIONS (INCLUDING LOSS OR DAMAGE WHICH YOU OR THIRDPARTIES MAY SUFFER).

11.4	SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

12	INDEMNIFICATION
YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD WIKITUDE AND ITS AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, CO-BRANDERS AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ANY LOSS, LIABILITY, CLAIM, DEMAND, DAMAGES, COSTS AND EXPENSES INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS FEES AND DISBURSEMENTS, MADE BY ANY THIRD PARTY DUE TO OR ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE WIKITUDE SDK, YOUR APPLICATIONS DEVELOPED ON THE WIKITUDE SDK THAT INFRINGE ANY COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, TRADE SECRET, TRADE DRESS, PATENT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT OF ANY PERSON OR DEFAMES ANY PERSON OR VIOLATES THEIR RIGHTS OF PUBLICITY OR PRIVACY, A VIOLATION OF ANY APPLICABLE LAWS OR A VIOLATION OF THE TERMS OF SERVICE.

13	TERM AND TERMINATION
13.1	The agreement between You and Wikitude which is concluded based on the Terms of Service is effective upon confirmation of acceptance of Your Product order by Wikitude. Belated request of the license key by You or belated receipt of the license key due to belated payment by You will not extend the term of Your License. 
 
13.2	Licenses granted to You by Wikitude free of charge shall remain in full force and effect for the period of time indicated in the Product Description unless terminated earlier by either party. Termination is possible for either party at any time. You may terminate the agreement prematurely by sending a written notice that You irrevocably cease to use the version of the Wikitude SDK licensed to You free of charge. Wikitude may terminate any licenses and services provided to You free of charge by deactivating the license key(s) provided to You by Wikitude.

13.3	If the agreement includes a term based Commercial License or a royalty-bearing license for Educational Purposes and unless otherwise provided in the Product Description the agreement will repeatedly be renewed for another term equal to the initial term unless You or Wikitude object to renewal with a written notice of 30 days prior to the end of the term. 

13.4	Upon good cause, either party may at any time terminate the agreement concluded between Wikitude and You under the Terms of Service with immediate effect. In particular, the following constitutes a good cause for immediate termination by Wikitude: If You use the Wikitude SDK in a way that is in breach of the granted license, in particular if You provide access to the Wikitude SDK to Third Parties; if You infringe any Intellectual Property Rights of Wikitude or other Third Parties; if You breach other essential provisions of the Terms of Service.

13.5	After termination You are no longer entitled to use the Wikitude SDK; neither are You entitled to any other services by Wikitude. Wikitude is entitled to deny access to Your developer account and to take technical measures to prevent further use of the Wikitude SDK. The distribution and making available of Derivative Works that were completed and made publicly available in accordance with the Terms of Service prior to termination may be continued. 

14	CHANGES
14.1	Wikitude holds the sole right to modify or replace the Terms of Service. If changes have been made, a new version of the Terms of Service will be published and made available on the website where the Wikitude SDK is made available.

14.2	It is agreed that the continued utilization of the Wikitude SDK after the publication of a new version or modification of the Terms of Service will be regarded as an acceptance of the new or modified Terms of Service. In any case, a new version or modification of the Terms of Service is deemed accepted by You four weeks after its publication.


15	APPLICABLE LAW
15.1	The Terms of Service and the use of the Wikitude SDK shall be governed by Austrian Law with the exclusion of the UN Sales Convention and the Austrian conflict of law rules of Austrian private international law.

15.2	Any disputes arising out of or in connection with the Terms of Service and the use of the Wikitude SDK, including disputes on its conclusion, binding effect, amendment and termination, shall be subject to exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts at Wikitude’s registered seat (i.e. Salzburg, Austria).


16	MISCELLANEOUS
16.1	Unless otherwise agreed by Wikitude in written form, the Terms of Service, the Product Description and the Wikitude Privacy Rules form the entire agreement between You and Wikitude concerning the subject matter herein, and supersedes all prior communications, proposals and representations with respect to the Wikitude SDK or any other subject matter covered herein. 

16.2	Notwithstanding any provision hereof, for all purposes of the Terms of Service, it is acknowledged that You shall be and act independently and not as partner, joint venturer, agent, employee or employer of Wikitude. You shall not have any authority to assume or create any obligation for or on behalf of Wikitude, expressively or implied, and shall not attempt to bind Wikitude to any contract.

16.3	The failure of any party at any time to enforce or require performance of any provision hereof shall in no way operate as a waiver or affect the right of such party at a later time to enforce the same. Any waiver of an obligation, agreement or condition contained herein shall be valid and effective only if in writing and signed by the party to whom such compliance is owed. No such waiver shall be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach, Claim or failure to perform, or of any obligation, agreement or condition other than the one expressly waived.

16.4	If any provision of the Terms of Service is held invalid or unenforceable, the provision will be construed to reflect the party’s original intent. Despite the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision, all other provisions of the Terms of Service will remain in full force and effect.
